    To create an environment:

    conda create --name myenv

    Note

    Replace myenv with the environment name.

    When conda asks you to proceed, type y:

    proceed ([y]/n)?

    This creates the myenv environment in /envs/. This environment uses the same version of Python that you are currently using because you did not specify a version.

    To create an environment with a specific version of Python:

    conda create -n myenv python=3.6

    To create an environment with a specific package:

    conda create -n myenv scipy

    OR:

    conda create -n myenv python
    conda install -n myenv scipy

    To create an environment with a specific version of a package:

    conda create -n myenv scipy=0.15.0

    OR:

    conda create -n myenv python
    conda install -n myenv scipy=0.15.0

    To create an environment with a specific version of Python and multiple packages:

    conda create -n myenv python=3.6 scipy=0.15.0 astroid babel

    Tip

    Install all the programs that you want in this environment at the same time. Installing 1 program at a time can lead to dependency conflicts.

To automatically install pip or another program every time a new environment is created, add the default programs to the create_default_packages section of your .condarc configuration file. The default packages are installed every time you create a new environment. If you do not want the default packages installed in a particular environment, use the --no-default-packages flag:

conda create --no-default-packages -n myenv python
